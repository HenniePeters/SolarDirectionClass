# SolarDirectionClass
A class to calculate the direction and elevation to the position of the sun  
It can also be used to prove that the earth is NOT flat :-)
    
Please note that calculations are only valid for dates between 1901 and 2099, due to an approximation used in the Julian Day calculation.
    
When you are pleased with this class and you wish to donate for the work that was  
involved with the conversion from VBA to C++. I will appreciate a donation on my patreon page:
