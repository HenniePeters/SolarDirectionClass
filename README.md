# SolarDirectionClass (for solar panels)
A class to calculate the direction and elevation of a solar panel to point it accurately to the position of the sun  
It can also be used to prove that the earth is NOT flat :-)
    
Please note that calculations are only valid for dates between 1901 and 2099, due to an approximation used in the Julian Day calculation.   

An example of how to use this class can be found in the main function at the end of main.cpp  

Modification, 2025-09-19:  
An axtra function was added to the class to determine whether the sun is up or down on a given date/time. I needed this to switch off a battery charger and to switch on an inverter during the night.  
  
Good luck,
